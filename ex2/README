=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
i implemented special classes for all the ship because every ship has specific details,
but there is functions that all the ships sharing so them exist in the class spaceships that is super
class for all classes of the ships.
all the class of the ship extends from the super class space ship.
spaceship - findTheClosestShip(SpaceWars game) - i added function that found the closest ship.
spaceship - addEnergy() - i added function that add energy.
spaceship Accel - I have added a Boolean condition that tests whether to accelerate.
spaceship Shield - I added a Boolean condition that changes when the shields are active.
=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
1. for drunkard i choose random to decide where to turn. and shooting  every couple rounds
2. for spacial i choose to make hum go to tha closest ship and if the ship close enough to other ship the
spacial shoot and also do telepot every couple rounds.
